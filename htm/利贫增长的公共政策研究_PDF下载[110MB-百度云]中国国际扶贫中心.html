　　there is a broad consensus that the growth process that brings
developing asian regions into the high growth path in recent years
is itself unequal. the experience of asia is， on the one hand，
characterized by large-scale poverty reduction and， on the other，
is the increase in inequality. in the process of developing， many
countries have witnessed increasing inequality and the wealth gap
between all income groups， regions and urban ancl rural areas is
increasingly widening. poverty reduction outcomes and the reality
of inequality are in stark contrast， which led to the query on
whether asia is experiencing pro-poor or inclusive growth. poverty
reduction reflects the inclusiveness， but the growing inequality
has shown an opposite conclusion. few countries have not only
achieved sustained economic growth， but also poverty and inequality
reduction iike malaysia.
　　in addition to the persistence of poverty and the growing
inequality， the recent estimates show that 72% of the world's poor
live in middle-income countries. despite the improvement in the
overall situation of poverty， many families in rural and urban
areas remain fragile. they are at or slightly above the poverty
line ancl it is very easy for them to return to poverty due to
rising medical and education costs or， more generally， the
imperfect social security systems. in recent years， due to rising
food prices， energy costs and the changes in environmental
conditions， many families have become increasingly vulnerable.
therefore， to the developing countries with a higher economic
growth rate and the mid.dle-income countnies， it is key to ensure
that the quality of economic growth will not weaken due to growing
inequality ancl to develop social， welfare and other public
policies to meet the needs of disadvantaged families as much as
possible.
