  插图：To assure widespread acceptance of new accounting standards, the FASBneeds the support of the SEC. Therefore, the two organizations work closelytogether in developing new accounting standards. The SEC also reviews thefinancial statements of publicly owned corporations to assure compliance with itsreporting requirements. In the event that a publicly owned corporation fails tocomply with these requirements, the SEC may initiate legal action against thecompany and the responsible individuals. Thus, the SEC"enforces" compliancewith generally accepted accounting principles.American Accounting Association （AAA） The AAA is comprised primarily ofaccounting educators. "The Association has sponsored a number of researchstudies and monographs in which individual authors and Association committeeshave taken positions on various accounting issues. However, the AAA does nothave any official authority to impose its views; its influence stems only from theprestige of its authors and the persuasiveness of their arguments.The AAA also sponsors the Accounting Education Change Commission,which currently is seeking new and innovative ways to enhance accountingeducation."Authoritative Support" for Accounting Principles To qualify as "generallyaccepted," an accounting principle must have "substantial authoritative support"Principles, standards, and rules set forth by the officialrule-making bodies of theaccounting profession, such as the FASB, automatically qualify as generallyaccepted accounting principles. However, many concepts and practices gainsubstantial authoritative support from unofficial sources, such as widespread useor recognition in textbooks and other "unofficial" accounting literature. Thus,the phrase "generally accepted accounting principles" includes more concepts andpractices than appear in the "official" literature.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
