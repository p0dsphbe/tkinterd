在当今时代，从事关国家安全的战略研究，到人们日常生活的改善，都离不开超级计算技术的支撑。本书讲述了我国超级计算机从无到有、从落后到领跑世界的艰辛历程。“银河”“天河”系列超级计算机的传奇故事，展现出了几代科学家、科研人的爱国奉献精神以及扎实的专业素养。Today, supercomputing is indispensable to the development of a nation—from strategic studies on the topic of national security to improvements in people’s living conditions. This book depicts the arduous journey of how China’s supercomputers developed from nothing and grew from being a laggard to a world leader. It tells the legendary story of China’s “Yinhe” and “Tianhe” series of supercomputers and it demonstrates the patriotic dedication and professionalism of generations of Chinese scientists and researchers in great detail.
