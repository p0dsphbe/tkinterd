《会计学——数字意味着什么》（第9版，双语教学版）是一本让读者熟悉和理解公司和其他经济组织财务报告的会计用书。《会计学——数字意味着什么》的目的不是让读者成为编制财务报表的行家，而是让读者略过会计流程的技术细节，了解会计数字之间的关系。因此，近30年来，《会计学——数字意味着什么》英文原版一直是美国会计学入门课程用量*大的四本书之一。
《会计学——数字意味着什么》包括财务会计和管理会计两个部分，共16章。具体章节如下：会计的今与昔；财务报表及会计概念与原则；财务报表数据的基本解释；簿记过程和会计事项分析；流动资产的会计处理和列示；不动产、厂房、设备及其他非流动资产的会计处理和列示；负债的会计处理和列示；财务报表分析；成本计划；成本控制等。
