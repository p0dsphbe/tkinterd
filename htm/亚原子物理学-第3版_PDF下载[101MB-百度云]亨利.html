<p>书名:亚原子物理学-第3版</p><p>作者:亨利</p><p>页数:620</p><p>定价:¥99.0</p><p>出版社:世界图书出版公司</p><p>出版日期:2015-01-01</p><p>ISBN:9787510086359</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Subatomic Physics, the physics of nuclei and particles, has been one of the frontiers of science since its birth in 1896. From the study of the radiations emitted by radioactive nuclei to the scattering experiments that point to the presence of subLuuts in nucleons, from the discovery of the hadroruc interactions to the real-ization that the photon possesses hadronic (strong) attributes, and that weak and electromagnetic forces may be intimately related, subatomic physics has enriched science with new concepts and deeper insights into the laws of nature.　　Subatomic Physics does not stand isolated; it bears on many aspects of life. Ideas and facts emerging from studies of the subatomic world change our picture of the macrocosmos. Concepts discovered in subatomic physics are needed to under-stand the creation and abundance of the elements, and the energy production in the sun and the stars, Nuclear power may provide most of the future energy sources.Nuclear bombs affect national and international decisions. Pion beams have be- come a tool to treat cancer. Tracer and Mossbauer techniques give information about structure and reactions in solid state physics, chemistry, biology, metallurgy, and geology.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
