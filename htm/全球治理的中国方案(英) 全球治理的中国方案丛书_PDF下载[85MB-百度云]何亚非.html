In China and Global Governance, He Yafei, a renowned career diplomat, reviews the origin and evolution of the concept of global governance and describes the gradual shift from the present governance by the West, its monopoly of global affairs, to joint governance by East and West, which champions multipolarity. Moreover, the author presents China’s perspectives, means, and goals concerning global governance—advancing the innovative Belt and Road Initiative, striving for global peace and mutual benefits in bilateral and multilateral relations, and building a shared future for mankind.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
