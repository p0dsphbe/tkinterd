This fact madeBaudouin de Courtenay's theory an important phase of the "pre-history"of phonology before Trubetzkoy's Grundziige der Phonologie.　　In Baudouin's days， phonology in its contemporary sense had not yetbeen established. Yet， phonology as a term had already been put to use.Naturally， this term must have been used in a different way from what oneis nowadays familiar with. To analyze how closely these "old" versions of"phonology" approximated the "standardized" definition， one must findout the following questions in each interpretation:　　What role does the study of speech sound play in the study oflanguage?　　What is the difference between phonology and the more establishedphonetics?　　Jakobson （1929b） noted that the phonetics-phonology distinctionbased on a functional principle had already existed in Baudouin's 1870inaugural lecture at St. Petersburg University:　　Das funktionale Anpacken der Sprachfakten charakterisiert bereitsdie Inaugurationsvorlesung Baudouins von 1870 an der PetersburgerUniversit.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《功能对立与雅柯布森的音位：雅柯布森音系学初探》没有依据传统方法，把雅柯布森音系学分为前期和后期，而是从雅柯布森音系学发展历程中贯穿始终的指导思想入手，分析其在整个雅柯布森音系学中的主导作用。这一指导思想就是功能主义背景下的对立观点，它贯穿于雅柯布森音系学的始终，从音位理论一直延伸至区别特征理论中。阅读《功能对立与雅柯布森的音位：雅柯布森音系学初探》可以为语言学界读者提供很好的音系学方面的参考。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
