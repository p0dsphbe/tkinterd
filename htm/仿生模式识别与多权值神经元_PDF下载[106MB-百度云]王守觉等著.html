                                        　　this book is the second one after the first book named "first
step to multi-dimensional space biomimetic informatics"（in
chinese）， which are both illuminating the novel biomimetic
high-dimensional space geometry computing theory， but this book is
more detailed and systemic. this book consists of three parts，
statistical pattern recognition， biomimetic pattern recognition and
multi-weight neuron. biomimetic pattern recognition and
multi-weight neuron are proposed by academician shoujue wang at the
start of representing digital data over hundreds of dimensionality
as points， and developed for five years with many applications in
many fields so far.                                    </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
