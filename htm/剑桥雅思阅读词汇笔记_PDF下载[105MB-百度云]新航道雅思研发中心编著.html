雅思考试中阅读对于词汇量的要求是*的，词汇不仅关系到具体题目的对错，有时候是否认识一个单词对于整篇文章的理解都至关重要。我们结合多年教学经验，以篇章为单元，逐篇逐段选取剑3～剑11中144篇文章的核心词汇和词组进行注释。每篇文章梳理出约200个左右的单词和短语，其中包含大量高中词汇，便于高中生起点的考生使用。另外，除A类阅读文章外，书中还收录了G类阅读中的单词和短语，全面突破。考生可以边做题边查生词，扫除阅读障碍，真正专注于英语阅读，研究解题技巧。本书中的单词均根据单词上下文进行精准释义，且每个单词只保留一个义项。为了达到通过阅读记单词的目的，我们把不同文章中重复的单词进行了多次注释。本词的多个义项还将会在后续文章中不断出现、被收录。读者遇到同一个单词的机会多了，记住的可能性就大大增加了。本书仅提供生词列表及精准释义，并不提供例句和记忆法，也没有同义词等扩充内容。这一做法旨在排除干扰，突出强调在阅读中理解单词、快速多遍“刷单词”。设计上本书采用简洁的32开版面，轻巧便捷，尤其适合利用间隙时间随时复习。
