After an introduction to the field the General Enterprise Modeling Architecture is presented. The new architecture includes a set of models and methods. It describes different aspects of the system and covers its life cycle. Its models are structuralized models with multi-layers and multi-views. They are descriptions and cognitions of the system at the top level and provide tools and methodology to understand, design, develop and implement the system. This book is intended for researchers and graduate students in the field of industrial engineering, management engineering and information engineering. Enterprise Models discussed in this book provide a rich source in enterprise diagnosis, business process reengineering and information system implementation.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
