Inone superbly printed four-color page after another, readers are invited on a guided tour of corporate America that will take them into such strategic locations as headquarters, regional operating centers, R&amp;amp;D facilities, call centers, law offices, showrooms and broadcast centers, to see where many of the nation's managers,professionaLs and other decision makers work. Business leaders and their architects and interior designers will find the book's scores of recently completed projects, showcased in hundreds of color images, provide an effective means of assessing their options for planning, designing and building state-of-the- art facilities. What does CORPORATE INTERIORS NO. 7 reveal about corporate America in the dawn of the 21st century? Consider the new U.S.headquarters of Sun Chemical, in Parsippany, New Jersey, which combines private offices and open work stations with such interactive facilities as a conference center, cafe lounge and cafeteria to foster creativity, and spikes its neutral color scheme with saturated accent colors to celebrate its role as the world's largest producer of printing inks and pigments. You may not realize at first that the Cincinnati office of Fifth Third Bancorp was once a warehouse, thanks to a recent conversion that has introduced new facades, windows, skylights and an airy, openplan office where bright colors identify individual departments and build company spirit. On the other hand, the attorneys and their support staff in the Houston office of Haynes and Boone are well aware their new workplace is not home, but that doesn't rule out an interior design that acknowledges tong hours on the job with such amenities as corridors with natural light and views, a break room for casual gatherings, and a two-story reception area that hosts special events. And why shouldn't there be room for serious fun at Gas Powered Games, a computer game developer in Redmond, Washington, where a monumental castle wall in the reception area evokes its legendary "Dungeon Siege" 3D title,and conference rooms can expand just by rolling up firehousestyle doors? Organized alphabetically by design firm, CORPORATE INTERIORS NO. 7 is meant for easy reference and repeated use, with each project indexed by company name and location. Corporate executives and architects and interior designers serving the corporate and institutional worlds will encounter fresh new working environments to challenge established ways of working and suggest new directions for reinventing organizations. Whether readers' preferences lean towards a more traditional setting, such as the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts interiors for Metropolitan Capital Bank, in Chicago,or a cutting-edge space, like the starkly modern Chicago office of Digitas, they will find much to stimulate their own imagination here.<br/>作者简介:<br/>Roger Yee, an architecture graduate of Yale School of Architecture, has received honors for his work in the field from such organizations as the American Institute of Architects,the American Society of Interior Designers and the Association of Business Publishers.
