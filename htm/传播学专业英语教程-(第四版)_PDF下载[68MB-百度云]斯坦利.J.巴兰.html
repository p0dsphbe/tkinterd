         N SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS--IN FACT, millions<br/>
       of people around the globe--went to bed in shock. The world had<br/>
changed. The United States no longer seemed invincible. Americans no<br/>
longer felt safe at home. As everyone, from politicians to pundits to the<br/>
people next door, said, "Nothing would ever be the same again." Much, in<br/>
 fact, is the same; but not our view of the mass media. The questions we were<br/>
 asking about media in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and the questions<br/>
we are raising now are shaped in large part by what happened on that<br/>
horrific day.<br/>
     At first we were impressed, even moved, by the performance of our<br/>
 mass media. The coverage of the attack and rescue effort in all media was<br/>
 thorough, knowledgeable, courageous, even-handed, and sensitive. But then<br/>
we started asking, Why were we caught so badly by surprise? Why didn't<br/>
we know about the anti-American feelings in much of the world? Where<br/>
 were the media? This question was asked again and again as the invasion<br/>
 of Iraq produced none of the weapons of mass destruction that had been<br/>
 the cause belli. Had the media been too compliant? Was their lack of aggres-<br/>
 sive checking a function of economic factors such as concentration and<br/>
 conglomeration? Were the media's failures in the run-up to war the fuel<br/>
 igniting an invigorated media reform movement at home on the political<br/>
 Right as well as the Left?<br/>
     But it did not take a cowardly terrorist attack on civilians or an inva-<br/>
 sion of a hostile country to start people thinking and talking about the<br/>
media. September 11 and the war in Iraq chased from the cultural forum<br/>
the relentless criticism of the media performance in the 2000presidential<br/>
elections.Dan Rather said that Media proresslonals<br/>
 their faces after that shameful failure of our democracy; they wore the<br/>
 entire omelet. People questioned the media's priorities--a missing Capitol<br/>
 Hill intern garnered more coverage than world events. Others were com-<br/>
 plaining that movies were starting to look like extra-long commercials,<br/>
 while television commercials were getting increasingly shorter and all<br/>
 media, even novels, were seemingly drowning in more and more advertis-<br/>
 ing. Critics across the political spectrum were concerned that media com-<br/>
 panies were merging at an unhealthy-for-democracy rate. Concern about<br/>
 media violence and sexual content remained unabated. Furor followed a<br/>
 television network's proposal to air hard-liquor ads. People who had lost<br/>
their life savings wanted to know what the media were doing while Enron<br/>
and WorldCom were stealing from them. To First Amendment advocates,<br/>
new copyright rules designed to thwart digital piracy were undoing two<br/>
centuries of fair use copyright protection, with consumers and democracy<br/>
poorer for it.<br/>
     The media, like sports and politics, are what we talk about. Argue over.<br/>
Dissect and analyze.<br/>
     Those of us who teach media know that these conversations are essen-<br/>
tial to the functioning of a democratic society. We also know that what<br/>
moves these conversations from the realm of chatting and griping to that of<br/>
effective public discourse is media education--the systematic study of<br/>
media and their operation in our political and economic system, as well as<br/>
their contribution to the development and maintenance of the culture that<br/>
binds us together and defines us. W</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
