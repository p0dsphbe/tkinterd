  插图：Officially the structure, which will be 22m taller than the Statue of Liberty and more than twice the height of Nelson's Column, is called the Arcelor Mittal Orbit2. It is named after the steel company owned by Lakshmi Mittal3, the richest man in Britain, who is paying most of the cost——and planting a giant advert in the Olympic site. However Mr Johnson immediately bombarded his new landmark with a fusillade of alternative names."Some may choose to think of it as the Colossus of Stratford," he said. "Some eyes may detect a helter-skelter or a supersized mutant trombone. Some may even see the world's biggest ever representation of a shisha pipe and call it The Hubble-Bubble. But I know that it is the ArcelorMittal Orbit. It represents the dynamism of a city coming out of recession and the embodiment of the cross- fertilisation of cultures and styles that makes London the world capital of arts, the cultural and creative industries.
