The genesis of Brahms's Violin Concerto in D major Op. 77 is in many ways inseparable from<br/>
the name of its dedicatee, Joseph Joachim (1831-1907). Brahms first heard Joachim in March<br/>
1848, when the violinist, not yet 17 years old but destined to become arguably the most cele-<br/>
brated violin virtuoso of the second half of the 19th century, had played the Beethoven con-<br/>
certo. 'Time and again', the composer later wrote to Joachim, 'the [Beethoven] concerto<br/>
reminds me of our first encounter, of which you, of course, know nothing. You played it in<br/>
Hamburg, [...] and ! was undoubtedly your most enthusiastic listener'. But it was not until<br/>
the end of May 1853 that the two men first met in Hannover, where Joachim was principal<br/>
violinist to the house of Hannover. Their mutual sympathy and profound respect for each<br/>
other as musicians soon matured into a lasting friendship, in the course of which Joachim<br/>
introduced Brahms to numerous violin concertos, including Giovanni Battista Viotti's Violin<br/>
Concerto No. 22 in A minor, a work that Brahms particularly admired. And Brahms in turn<br/>
appears to have advised Joachim when he came to write his own Violin Concerto 'in the<br/>
Hungarian style'. It was a friendship, finally, in which - to quote the composer's biographer,<br/>
Max Kalbeck - Brahms 'very soon conceived the idea of writing a really beautiful work for<br/>
the royal instrument of his beloved Jussuf [Joseph], a work that would be both great and<br/>
demanding and entirely worthy of that instrument'.<br/>
In the event it was not until the summer of 1878, when Brahms was staying at P6rtschach on<br/>
the Worthersee, that this idea was finally realised. Brahms had spent the previous summer,<br/>
too, in this delightful corner of rural Carinthia, working on his Second Symphony, and on<br/>
that occasion he had described the region in a letter to his friend Eduard Hanslick as 'virginal<br/>
territory, melodies fly through the air here and you must be careful not to tread on them'.<br/>
Twelve years later he recalled his time in Portschach: 'Beautiful summer days come to mind<br/>
and, involuntarily, so too do many of the works that I took with me on my walks - the D<br/>
major Symphony, the Violin Concerto, the G major Sonata, the Rhapsodies and the like. And<br/>
"is the old man still alive"? I mean the old priest, that frivolous old joker. His laughter could<br/>
be heard (literally) across the lake, his extremely bad jokes even as far away as Vienna.' The<br/>
 absence of relevant sources makes it impossible for us to know if Brahms wrote down his<br/>
Violin Concerto in the summer of 1878 on the basis of existing sketches and drafts or whether<br/>
he in fact composed it in its entirety in Potschach in 1878. By the same token, we can only<br/>
speculate on the reasons why Brahms waited until the summer of 1878 to write such a work:<br/>
after all, he had first met Joachim a quarter of a century earlier. Perhaps it was the worldwide<br/>
success of his Second Symphony, which had received its first performance in Vienna on 30<br/>
December 1877 and which, confirming its composer's now incontrovertible reputation,<br/>
helped to overcome the lacerating self-doubts characteristic of his career until now, that<br/>
gave him the confidence to return to the concerto as a genre after his successful engagement<br/>
with the symphony. After all, the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor<br/>
Op. 15 in Hannover on 22 January 1859 had been the greatest artistic debacle of his life. It is<br/>
ultimately also impossible to know whether it was not only his friendship with Joachim that<br/>
persuaded him to choose the violin as a solo instrument but also - as Kalbeck suggests - the<br/>
playing of the Spanish virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate, whom Brahms heard in Baden-Baden in<br/>
the autumn of 1877 rehearsing Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 2 in D minor Op. 44.<br/>
By contrast, the final phase in the concerto's genesis is rather more fully documented, and<br/>
here we know that Joachim played an active role. On 22 August 1878 Brahms sent him a<br/>
parcel containing the solo part of the opening movement and a letter couched in the ironic<br/>
and witty language that the composer - a pianist, rather than a violinist by training - often<br/>
adopted in his correspondence: 'I'll be satisfied if you say the odd word and perhaps write<br/>
your comments into it [i.e., into the violin part]: difficult, awkward, impossible, that sort of<br/>
thing. The whole thing has four movements, I'm writing the beginning of the last one so that<br/>
the awkward passages are forbidden me right away!' Joachim lost no time in responding to<br/>
Brahms's request, writing his suggested changes into the solo part and spelling them out in<br/>
greater detail at two subsequent meetings that he held with the composer, the first in<br/>
Po3rtschach at the end of August 1878, the second in Hamburg at the end of September 1878.<br/>
No doubt he additionally demonstrated them on his violin. He also wrote the opening move-<br/>
ment's solo cadenza.<br/>
There was no question in Brahms's mind that Joachim should give the first performance, and<br/>
yet he seems to have been disconcerted by the haste with which the violinist insisted on bring-<br/>
ing forward the date of that performance. As early as the middle of October 1878 Joachim<br/>
was already writing to announce that he was thinking of playing it at the traditional New Year<br/>
concert in Leipzig and therefore needed it in its entirety very soon, prompting Brahms to<br/>
' write back to say that he 'did not like to be rushed when writing and performing' his music,<br/>
especially because in the present case he was now revising what had been planned as a four-<br/>
movement work and turning it into a traditional three-movement concerto. Brahms must<br/>
have been working on these revisions as late as November, for in a letter to Joachim we find<br/>
him reporting that 'The middle movements have fallen in battle - needless to add, they were<br/>
the best! But I'll have a poor Adagio [the second movement of the finished work] written for<br/>
it.' It was the middle of December by the time that Joachim received the new solo part of<br/>
what was now a three-movement work. Yet, in spite of the pressure of time, it was still not too<br/>
late for the concerto to be premiered at the Leipzig New Year concert on 1 January 1879 with<br/>
the Gewandhaus Orchestra under Brahms's direction. Joachim was the soloist.<br/>
 'In sum', wrote Alfred Dorffel in the Leipziger Nachrichten, reporting on the initial reaction to<br/>
the concerto, 'the first movement prevented its audience from noticing what was novel about<br/>
the work, but the second movement left a very real impression; and the final movement gave<br/>
rise to much cheering.' Both in Leipzig and at the work's first performance in Vienna on 14<br/>
January 1879, the critics agreed that this 'may be described as the most important concerto to<br/>
have appeared since those of Beethoven and Mendelssohn'. It was above all the symphonic<br/>
dimension of the work that contributed to this sense of importance. The solo instrument does<br/>
not dominate, and the soloist's abilities are not privileged in any way. Rather, violin and<br/>
orchestra merge in the sense of a higher musical unity. In spite of this, the writing for the solo<br/>
violin is extremely virtuosic with its multiple stopping, rapid changes of position and passage-<br/>
work. Yet none of these are an end in themselves. Instead, they are fully integrated into a<br/>
structure in which the themes are symphonically presented, reworked and developed with all<br/>
the expressive variety of the musical language of the Po3rtschach Brahms: the writing is by<br/>
turns brooding, serenade-like, pastoral and what Hanslick termed 'garden music'. Passages of<br/>
great seriousness appear alongside others that are playful and witty, most notably in the third<br/>
movement, an Allegro giocoso. Like the Second Symphony that Brahms had written in<br/>
Po3rtschach the previous summer, the work as a whole is imbued with a sense of carefree<br/>
amiability that in Simrock's words is 'full of sunshine'.<br/>
