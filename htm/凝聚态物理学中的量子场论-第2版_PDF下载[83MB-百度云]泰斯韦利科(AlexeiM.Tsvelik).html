The only part ofit which is well understood concerns a situation where localized electrons are representedby a single local magnetic moment （the Kondo problem）. In this case we know that thelocal moment is screened at low temperatures by conduction electrons and the ground stateis a singlet. The formation of this singlet state is a nonperturbative process which affectselectrons very far from the impurity. The relevant energy scale （the Kondo temperature） isexponentially small in the exchange coupling constant. It still remains unclear how conduc-tion and localized electrons reconcile with each other when the local moments are arrangedregularly （Kondo lattice problem）. Empirically, Kondo lattices resemble metals with verysmall Fermi energies of the order of several degrees. It is widely believed that conductionand localized electrons in Kondo lattices hybridize at low temperatures to create a singlenarrow band （see the discussion in Chapter 21）. However, our understanding of the detailsof this process remains vague. The most interesting problem is how the localized electronscontribute to the volume of the Fermi sea （according to the large-N approximation, they docontribute）. The most dramatic effect of this contribution is expected to occur in systemswith one conduction electron and one spin per unit cell. Such systems must be insulators（the so-called Kondo insulator）.The available experimental data apparently support thispoint of view: all compounds with an odd number of conduction electrons per spin areinsulators （Aeppli and Fisk, 1992）.
