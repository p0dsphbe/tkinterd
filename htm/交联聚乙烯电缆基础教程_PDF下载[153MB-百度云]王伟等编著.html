all;erformance of the material and construction on xlpe insulated
power cablefrom theoretical and performance calculation, and tell
about the option,installation, operation, maintain, test on site,
hand-over and prevention test, teststandard and standard demand
over this base. this book also introduce the somemanagerial
experiences used to xlpe insulated power cable on the electric
power supply bureau, and analyse the development tendency of xlpe
insulated cable.
　　the book is a studied and worked handbook of engineer necessity
used onthe xlpe insulation cable, a reference book of engineer at
the electric powersupply bureau in china.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
