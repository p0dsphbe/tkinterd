Through the progress of science and technology and the intensive utilization ofland， the great achievements have been made in agriculture. However， some agro-ecological and environmental problems are rising （11 2008）. People have begun to reflect on agricultural development policies， patterns and technologies，and put forward new thoughts for agricultural development in succession，such as organic agriculture， biological agriculture， natural agriculture，integrated agriculture， cycling agriculture， ecological agriculture and sustainable agriculture （Cheng et al. 1997）. The names and meaning of these terms vary， but all reflect the ecological thought and the strong need and desire to explore sustainable agriculture. There is growing awareness that the development of agriculture is not only the increase of the amount of food and agricultural products but also the improvement of product quality， insurance of food safety， exertion of ecosystem functions and maintenance and restoration of the ecological environment. 　　The long history of intensive cultivation customscombined with a vast expanse and extremely complex geography provides unusual social and technical conditions in the development of low input and highly intensive agriculture in China （Lu0 2007）. However， characteristics such as a large population， land scarcity， water resource shortages， environmental vulnerability and complicated natural conditions， large ecological deficits， and rural poverty mean that it is very difficult to nationally popularize the patterns adopted by developed countries. It is necessary to explore a modern agriculture development route with Chinese characteristics （11 2004）. In the late 20th century China's ecologists and agronomists co-sponsored the concept of ecological agriculture with Chinese characteristics： "The ecological agriculture is deriving from systematic thoughts， according to the principles of ecology，economics， and ecological economics， with the application of modern scientific and technological achievements and modern management tools，as well as the effective experiences of traditional agriculture. It is the modern agricultural development model to obtain a higher economic profit， ecological and social benefits." （Ma 1997; Ye 1998）. Its essence includes a series of concepts such as integration， coordination，circulation， and regeneration. 　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《农业文化遗产研究丛书·重要农业文化遗产的动态保护和适应性管理：理论与实践》内容包括农业文化遗产的保护和利用是一个全新的课题，论文集收录了该领域前沿的文章，能为我国系统开展农业文化遗产提供一个很好的平台，由自然中心和文化遗产研究所地理科学和自然资源研究用。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
