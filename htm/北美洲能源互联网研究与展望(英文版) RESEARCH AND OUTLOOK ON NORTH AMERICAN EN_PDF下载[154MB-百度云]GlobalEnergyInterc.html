This report is one of the GEI research series. Based on the requirements of sustainable development in North America, it systematically studies the development of North American Energy Interconnection. It is divided into 7 chapters. In Chapter 1, the development status of the economy, society, resources, environment, energy and electricity in North America is introduced. In Chapter 2, the challenges for sustainable development and an energy transition in North America are analyzed, and development ideas for North American Energy Interconnection are proposed. In Chapter 3, guided by achieving the 2°C temperature control target, the development trend for an energy and electricity transition in North America is prospected, with corresponding proposed scenarios. In Chapter 4, the distribution of clean energy resources and the layout of major power generation bases are studied. In Chapter 5, based on the analysis of the power balance, the overall layout and interconnection scheme of North American Energy Interconnection are proposed. In Chapter 6, the comprehensive benefits brought by building North American Energy Interconnection are assessed. In Chapter 7, the clean energy and power development path with its scenario in North America to achieve 1.5°C temperature control target is prospected.
