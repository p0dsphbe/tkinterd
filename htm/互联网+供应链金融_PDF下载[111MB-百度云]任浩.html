供应链产生于社会化大生产所需求的专业化分工，就其本质而言，是为了解决商品生产与消费过程中时间与空间不一致。然而越来越复杂的产品和越来越长的生产周期，使供应链体系内存在的大量物资成为企业发展的沉重负担。 供应链金融的出现，使企业流通过程中的物资有可能转化为可动用的资金，给企业的运营带来了一线曙光，但是供应链体系内大量存在的信息不对称却将这种服务在广大中小型企业面前竖立了一堵玻璃墙。 互联网的出现改变了这个世界，也在改变供应链金融存在的根基，层出不穷的新技术手段正在使这个世界变得越来越小，也越来越透明，尤其是互联网思维，正在深刻的改变着人们的思考和行为模式。本书从供应链金融在中国发展的现状说起，重点分析互联网可能给供应链体系带来什么样的变化从而引发整个价值链的重组，希望能为各方提供一种新的视角，推动相关企业和行业的发展。
