Changes in the underlying trends of the times as the foundation and premise of my thoughts　　Those familiar with Chinese politics know that the CPC is China's core leadership in reform and development, According to the Constitution of the CPC, the Party agencies of highest authority are the National. Congress and the Central Committee （members of the latter being selected by the former）. Thus, every time a National Congress or Central Committee convenes, decisions must be made on reform and development. Furthermore, we know that in China, a great amount of the Of etical research （especially on policy） usually occurs around the time that the National Congress and Central Committee convene. Here, I relate how my thoughts on econo.mic globalization and the peaceful rise of China have evolved on a timeline centered on National Congresses.　　We must begin with the time period between Octobef of 1987 （13th CPC National Congress） and October of 1992 （14th CPC National Congress）. At that time, I was working at the then China Center for International Affairs under the State Council and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. BefOfe that, I had worked at the Reseafch Office of Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. The first time I came across the issue at hand was in April of 1988, and I spoke on it at an international forum: "The world has embarked upon a period of massive transition symbolized by a wave of reform and adjustment on the global scale." The reason for this is that multipolarity had begun to emerge globally and could not be stopped, and the ovefall structure of the world as established after World War II would be difficult to maintain. Pressed by a series of major imbalances in the global economy, the social systems and　　economic structures of various countries would also be difficult to main tain. The revolution of new technology was only beginrung to unfold,　　and it was posing nations greater challenges than they had ever faced.　　Thus, I believed that this would "bring about yet another great transition to the overall structure of world strategies that were established after WOfld War II, and such transition is to be related to the future of the　　world and every nation during the 21st century." Furthermore, I believed　　contemporary China was also experiencing a huge, unprecedented soaal　　transition. Later, I stated in an essay entitled "Massive Transformation,　　Becoming Reacquainted:' "China, a nation of one billion people that has fallen behind economically and cultrually, must achieve national rejuvenation while carrying out modernization and comprehensive reform in the face of developments taking place at the end of the 20th centruy andthe first part of the 21st century. Ttus is a social transition based on socialism that China has never seen before."2 I also proposed this: "As for speaking of the times, Deng Xiaoping once pointedly stated that peace and development are two great themes for the world of today. He also　　stated that the global 'East-West issue' is one of peace, and the 'NorthSouth issue' is one of development. This is extremely important for us in scientifically understanding these times."3 In fact, for all aspects of the wave of reform and adjustment on the global scale mentioned above, the basic premise lies in the fact that the theme of the times, as Deng pointed out, has akeady transitioned into one of peace and development. This could be said to have been the starting point of the next 30 years of my research work.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>中国作为崛起中的后起大国，西方既有认同，也有担忧，目前总的情况是担忧大于认同，“中国威胁论”和“中国崩溃论”均有一定市场。针对此，本书全面论述了中国和平崛起道路的由来、根据、内涵与前景，指出了中国和平崛起道路实质就是在以和平与发展为时代主题的条件下，同经济优选化相联系而不是相脱离的进程中，独立自主地建设中国特色社会主义，使中国作为维护世界和平的坚定力量实现崛起。力求让世界全面清晰地了解中国和平发展观的理论内涵，引导靠前主流舆论。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　郑必坚，1932年生，四川富顺人。1952年加入中国共产党，1954年中国人民大学政治经济学系研究生毕业。历任中共中央文献研究室组长、中共中央书记处研究室室务委员、中共中央***胡耀邦的政治助理、国务院国际问题研究中心副总干事、中国社会科学院副院长兼马列所所长、中其中央宣传部常务副部长、中共中央党校常务副校长、中国改革开放论坛理事长。系中国共产党第十四届、第十五届中央委员。现任中共中央党校学术委员会主任、国家创新与发展战略研究会会长。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
