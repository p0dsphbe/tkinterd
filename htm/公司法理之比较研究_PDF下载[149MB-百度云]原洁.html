公司治理是一个全球性的论题。目前，有一个趋势就是许多国家选择采用美国的公司治理模式。中国应该选择怎样的公司治理模式？这个实际问题的背后隐含了公司治理领域里两个根本性的理论问题，其一是关于是否存在*优公司治理模式的争论，其二是如何实施公司治理规则，政府应该在何种限度之内干预公司的治理。关于*一个问题，本书对美国的公司治理模式是*优方式这一观点持不同看法，因为美国公司治理模式下的独立董事制度存在诸多内在缺陷和未解决的困局，没有我们预想的完善。另外，同一个公司治理模式在不同国家市场环境下发挥的作用也会不同，很难断言哪个公司治理模式更好；与此同时，公司治理模式之间亦出现功能性整合的趋势。关于第二个问题，本书认为有必要在政府干预和市场干预中寻求一个平衡，采用由企业自主选择的方式可以在某种程度上促使公司治理模式之间的竞争。<br/>公司治理是一个全球性的论题。目前，有一个趋势就是许多国家选择采用美国的公司治理模式。中国应该选择怎样的公司治理模式？这个实际问题的背后隐含了公司治理领域里两个根本性的理论问题，其一是关于是否存在*优公司治理模式的争论，其二是如何实施公司治理规则，政府应该在何种限度之内干预公司的治理。关于*一个问题，本书对美国的公司治理模式是*优方式这一观点持不同看法，因为美国公司治理模式下的独立董事制度存在诸多内在缺陷和未解决的困局，没有我们预想的完善。另外，同一个公司治理模式在不同国家市场环境下发挥的作用也会不同，很难断言哪个公司治理模式更好；与此同时，公司治理模式之间亦出现功能性整合的趋势。关于第二个问题，本书认为有必要在政府干预和市场干预中寻求一个平衡，采用由企业自主选择的方式可以在某种程度上促使公司治理模式之间的竞争。
 
Corporate governance is a global topic. There is a trend that many countries choose to follow US’ model. Which model of corporate governance shall China choose? Behind this practical question, involved are two fundamental theoretical issues within corporate governance regime. One is the debate over whether the best practice of corporate governance exists, and the other is how to implement corporate governance rules, and to which extent the government should intervene in the governance of corporations. This paper disagrees with the assertion that “Anglo-American” model is the best practice, arguing that the device of independent director system under “Anglo-American” model has many internal weaknesses and unsolved dilemma, not perfect as we assumed. In addition, the same corporate governance model may have different effect in different countries and markets, and it is difficult to tell which corporate governance system is better. Meanwhile, there is a tendency of functional convergence among the corporate governance models. With respect to the second, this paper holds the view that it is necessary to find a balance between governmental influence and market influence, and to certain extent, optional approach can provide competition among corporate governance models.信息
